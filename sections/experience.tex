\subsection{{Sr. Backend Engineer / Appier, Inc. \hfill Taipei, Taiwan \> Mar 2023 --- Now}}
\subtext{LLM Prediction Service}
\begin{zitemize}
\item Led the development of an LLM-powered service, implementing a robust prompt engineering pipeline with Haystack and FastAPI. Integrated OpenTelemetry, Google Cloud Trace for comprehensive monitoring of usage, costs, and prediction performance. Delivered a clean, well-documented codebase using tools like ruff, pre-commit, and Pydantic.
\item Designed and implemented an LLM batch prediction framework using Airflow's dynamic task mapping and deferrable operators, optimizing scalability for large-scale user segmentation with Trino. Successfully integrated OpenAI batch operations, ensuring compliance with SLA requirements.
\end{zitemize}

\subtext{Data Connectors}
\begin{zitemize}
\item Led end-to-end development of a scalable error handling microservice supporting 7 connection types (S3 bucket, S3 file, GCS, SFTP, BigQuery, Google Sheets). Delivered Airbyte API integration and successfully deployed the enhancement, improving system reliability and troubleshooting efficiency.
\item Resolved a longstanding pod creation issue in Airbyte data integration that previously required manual restarts. Setup OpenTelemetry metrics collection to proactively alert on failed connection creation, enhancing system observability.
\end{zitemize}

\subtext{Segmentation System}
\begin{zitemize}
\item Designed and implemented integration across 6 feature components using the Feature Flag Decorator pattern, ensuring code maintainability and enabling ease of unit testing while accelerating feature delivery.
\item Designed offline event segmentation and data preprocessing workflows leveraging Celery, Trino, and GraphQL. Accelerated feature delivery by 60\% and achieved 100\% key results completion, including custom segmentation conditions and a unified data model.
\end{zitemize}

\subsection{{Data Engineer / Tresl, Inc. \hfill Palo Alto, CA \> Oct 2022 --- Nov 2022}}
\subtext{airbyte}
\begin{zitemize}
\item Decoupled the customer data extraction and loading workflow from Airflow by using Airbyte. Reduce the complexity of the DAGs and the CPU usage of Airflow by around 20\%.
\item Built the ETL pipelines that extract data from various sources, load them into the GCS and send them to BigQuery for further analysis.
\end{zitemize}


\subsection{{ML Engineer / Miso Technologies, Inc.  \hfill San Francisco, CA \> May 2021 --- May 2022}}

\subtext{miso-webhook}
\begin{zitemize}
\item Responsible for building the ETL pipelines for ingesting data from Shopify API and sending them into internal data API in around 80 requests per minute from Shopify Webhook API.
\item Reduce response time by 80\% by using multi-layer caching consisting of memory cache and Redis cache to avoid taking too much time on fetching authentication data from the internal API.
\end{zitemize}


\subtext{string-index}
\begin{zitemize}
\item Responsible for building a key-value store for mapping productID/userID into integer and ndarray at a performance around 4 ms per 11 million query words, which is the core component used in search and recommendation models.
\item Reduce the memory usage by 85\% with 11 million tokens input by switching the hash map into DAWG to record the tokens. Persist the tokens in the disk and achieve the purpose of sharing memory through mmap.
\item Decoupled the string-index component from the code base to make it easier to maintain and extend. Build a standalone package with complete usage documentation, 100\% unit test coverage, and a unified coding style conforming to the black, pylint rules.
\end{zitemize}

\subtext{python-package-template}
\begin{zitemize}
\item Shorten development environment setup time by 60\% by using Cookiecutter. Supporting virtual environment management tools like pipenv/poetry, pre-commit hooks, linting, testing, formatting commands, and GitLab CI/CD, Dockerfile configurations.
\end{zitemize}
